# action-lab
General lab library for everyday tasks.

This repository contains code I use for frequent tasks in a number projects; it is very much in its early stages. It includes some data handling utilities as well as pipelines for fMRI analysis (using Nipype). There are also some experimental design utilities I have used. Lots more to come (and documentation as well...)!
